# Workbench
Formally known as, what is being currently worked on. 



              Currently I have little to no experience Command Straight Line Script/ASCII, Form or Compliation.  Up Until now.  I need help Re-Creating Binary Command Script Code from Basic Text File, into a Usable Format.  I do not know how to convert Files from my Path directly from my Terminal as well as I do not know how to Operate the Terminal to the best of my abilities yet.  
              
              Yet,
                I have a Goal!~
